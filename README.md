C++  CODES
-----------
C++ is a powerful, general-purpose, and object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language. It is known for its performance, efficiency, and level of control over system resources and memory. 

C++ supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, which promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.
