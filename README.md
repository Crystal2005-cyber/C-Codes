C++  CODES
-----------
C++ is a powerful, general-purpose, and object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language. It is known for its performance, efficiency, and level of control over system resources and memory. 

C++ supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, which promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.

Some of the codes include the following queries :

1. Write a simple C++ program to find the greatest among four given numbers.
Example: int A=100, B=222, C=33, D=555. 
 
2. Write a simple C++ program to exchange or swap any two numbers without using a temporary variable.

3. Write a simple C++ program to check whether a given number is Armstrong or not.

4. Write a simple C++ program to generate a number pyramid.
 
5. Write a simple C++ program to calculate the sum, mean, median, and average value of an array.
